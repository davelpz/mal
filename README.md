# mal
My attempt at Make A Lisp (mal) https://github.com/kanaka/mal/blob/master/process/guide.md


There's already a rust implementation in the mal repo, so I'm doing my version here.

There are 9 steps in the process

- Step 0: The REPL
- Step 1: Read and Print
- Step 2: Eval
- Step 3: Environments
- Step 4: If Fn Do
- Step 5: Tail call optimization
- Step 6: Files, Mutation, and Evil
- Step 7: Quoting
- Step 8: Macros
- Step 9: Try
- Step A: Metadata, Self-hosting and Interop

I'm currently at Step 9
